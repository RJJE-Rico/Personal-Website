Hey，我是Rico Jia（a.k.a. Rico），一个略懂机器人技术与计算机科学的斜杆不动青年，专攻机器人导航和深度神经网络，热爱从零实现有趣的想法。自诩是一个UBC电子工程系和西北大学机器人(师从 [Prof.Matthew Elwin](https://robotics.northwestern.edu/people/profiles/faculty/elwin-matt.html))系杂交出来的极客与歌手。

现为机器人软件工程师，致力于机器人基础软件开发、导航和机器学习相关工作。之前曾在Northwestern Univerisity Shirley Ryan Ability Lab, Accel Robotics 做签约软件工程师，并在Diligent Robotics担任项目负责人

目前在休斯顿生活，并且是当地一支足球队的队长兼前锋。此外，我还在学习土耳其语, 西班牙语。物理活动范围在美帝德州。将来也想当个数字游<del>民</del>侠。虚拟分身日常出没于 [Github](https://github.com/RicoJia) 等。

Merhaba! I'm Rico Jia (a.k.a. Rico), a robotics technology a knack for robotics navigation and deep neural networks. I love bringing interesting ideas to life from scratch. I proudly consider myself a hybrid geek and singer, having studied at UBC's Electrical Engineering department and Northwestern University's Robotics department (under [Prof. Matthew Elwin](https://robotics.northwestern.edu/people/profiles/faculty/elwin-matt.html)). As a native to Beijing, China, I love sharing what I've seen in both Mandarin and English. 

Currently, I work as a robotics software engineer, focusing on robotics software infrastructure development, navigation, and machine learning for robotics. Previously, I was a software engineer at Northwestern University's Shirley Ryan AbilityLab and Accel Robotics, and I also served as a project lead at Diligent Robotics.

I live in Houston and am the captain and forward of a local soccer team. In, I am learning Turkish and Spanish. My physical activities are primarily based in Texas, USA. In the future, I aspire to be a digital nomad. My virtual presence can be found on [Github](https://github.com/RicoJia).
